# System Flow Diagrams Documentation

## 1. User Authentication Flow
### Purpose
The User Authentication diagram outlines the security process for verifying user identity and managing access to the system.

### Key Decisions and Processes
1. **Credential Input**
   - Captures username and password
   - Initial point of user interaction

2. **Authentication Process**
   - Validates user credentials
   - Implements retry mechanism for failed attempts

3. **Access Token Management**
   - Generates secure access tokens for authenticated users
   - Verifies token generation success

4. **Login Status Handling**
   - Clear success/failure paths
   - Proper error messaging
   - Option to retry after failed attempts

5. **Security Measures**
   - Structured authentication flow
   - Multiple validation checkpoints
   - Secure token-based access control

## 2. Transaction Handling Flow
### Purpose
The Transaction Handling diagram illustrates the complete flow of how the system processes and validates financial transactions, ensuring secure and accurate transaction processing.

### Key Decisions and Processes
1. **Account Validation**
   - Initial verification of account validity
   - Prevention of transactions from invalid accounts

2. **Balance Verification**
   - Checks if the account has sufficient balance
   - Prevents overdraft by rejecting insufficient balance transactions

3. **Transaction Processing**
   - Multi-step process including:
     - Transaction initiation
     - Transaction history generation
     - Transaction completion
   - Ensures complete tracking of transaction lifecycle

4. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages for invalid accounts
   - Specific handling for insufficient balance cases
